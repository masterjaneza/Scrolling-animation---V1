# Scrolling Animation | V1

This project is a functional (but not fancy) demo of scroll-triggered animations using plain HTML and CSS. It's not meant to win beauty contests—it’s just a straightforward playground to test how elements appear as they enter the viewport.

## 🚀 What It Does

- Generates a bunch of colored blocks (`div.block`) on the page.
- Each block fades and "unmasks" itself with a `clip-path` animation when it scrolls into view.
- Layout is done with flexbox (`.view` wraps the `.block` elements).
- The animation is handled using the new CSS Scroll-Linked Animations spec (`animation-timeline: view()`).

## 📦 Files

### `index.html`
- Basic HTML5 structure.
- Includes a `<link>` to `style.css` for styling.
- Renders 60 `.block` elements inside a `.view` container.
